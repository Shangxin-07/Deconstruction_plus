# Deconstruction_plus
Mod for Cataclysm-DDA that adds more deconstruction options and a power tool.

Fair warning, deconstruction is aimed to be a mid-game activity, while modifying an existing building to suit
base needs, as such, most recipes require more tools to deconstruct than you'd use to construct them.

## Currently allows deconstruction of (most)
- empty window frames
- floors
- linoleum tiles
- concrete floors
- walls
- wooden walls
- brick walls
- concrete walls

## Adds this powertool
- Masonry Saw
