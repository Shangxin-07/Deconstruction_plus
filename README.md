# Deconstruction_plus
Mod for Cataclysm-DDA that adds more deconstruction options and a power tool.

I got fed up that the only way to make changes to established houses was to BREAK ALL THE THINGS, when we 
have a suite of power tools and plenty of time (this was causing roof collapse ~80% of the time), so I made 
this mod to stop myself jumping into debug mode to fix the issue.

Fair warning, deconstruction of buildings is aimed to be a mid-game activity, while modifying existing 
buildings to suit base needs, and as such, most recipes require more tools to deconstruct than you'd use to 
construct them and a decent whack of time. The trade off is that you don't risk roof collapse and the 
floor tile is more or less preserved.

## Currently allows deconstruction of (most)
- empty window frames
- floors
- linoleum tiles
- concrete floors
- walls
- wooden walls
- brick walls
- concrete walls
- stone walls
- roads / pavement / zebra crossings
- metal doors
- rebar cages
- concrete columns
- half complete walls
- glass walls
- glass doors
- fireplaces


## Adds this powertool
- Masonry Saw (and an easy recipe to create it)

## For Cataclysm Bright Nights / CDDA 0.E
Download the mod as per normal, then... 

DELETE the following files:
- construction_recipes.json
- construction_groups.json
- modinfo.json
- tools.json

RENAME the files with .BN in the filename by replacing .BN with .json.
- construction_recipes.BN -> construction_recipes.json
- modinfo.BN -> modinfo.json 
- tools.BN -> tools.json
- There is no construction_groups for BN, the information that is in that file is included in construction_recipes.BN

Please note, the BN files are generated by script after the CDDA files are created by hand and then 
all files are linted by the CDDA tool, so everything should look more or less "game ready". (Whoooo)
